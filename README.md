boxfit
======

This source code will be maintained in coffeescript and compiled over to JavaScript (just a personal preference). Patches can be submitted in either and I'll just re-write it.

To use:

```html
<div id="my-big-box" style="width: 500px; height: 500px">This is some text</div>
```

```javascript
$('#my-big-box').boxfit();
```

This will make the text appear very large to take up the entire 500x500 area as best it can.
